By the end of the tutorial you’ll know how to:

- Model data using Xcode’s model editor
- Add new records to Core Data
- Fetch a set of records from Core Data
- Display the fetched records using a table view.

You’ll also get a sense of what Core Data is doing behind the scenes, and how you can interact with the various moving pieces.
